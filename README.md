# Memory-Safe-Coding-Language

### This repository is the repository of the Memory Safe Coding Language, it aims at creating a coding language that will be memory safe to prevent memory leaks, and aims at making computers more stable and permit peoples to code things faster and easier.
### This repository is the base which compilers will have to follow.


## Memory Safe Coding Language built in variables

Variable name | Value |
--- | --- |
NULL | Assembly NULL or 0x0 |


## Memory Safe Coding Language types

Type name | Bits size | minimum value | maximum value |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
bit | 1 | 0 | 1 |
int | 8 | -127 | 128 |
unsigned int | 8 | 0 | 255 |
char | 8 | 0x0 ( NUL ) | 0xFF ( Ã¿ in ASCII ) |
float | 32 | -3.4*10-38 | 3.4*10-38 |
unsigned float | 32 | 0 | 0. |
string | no minimum | 0x00 | no maximum |
array | size of the type | 0x00 | total ram size in bits minus the ram used by the OS |

#### string is an array of char


## Memory Safe Coding Language built in functions

function name | function usage | function description |
--- | --- | --- |
function | function function_name(arguments) | ```creates a new function that takes in input some arguments or nothing``` |
sizeof | sizeof(arguments) | ```returns the size in bits of anything``` |
struct | struct {arguments} | ```creates a new structure that will hold a specific list of types in order``` |
create_file | createfile(file_full_path, content, text_encoding) | ```creates a file that has a specific name at a specific path ( file_full_path being a string and containing the path at which the file will be created as well as the name of the file ) and pushes the value of content ( content being a string ) inside it using the encoding given in text_encoding ( text_encoding being a string )``` |
modify_file | modify_file(file_full_path, content, encoding) | ```modify the file ( given at the end of file_full_path ) at the specified path ( given at the start of file_full_path ) and replaces the previous content with the value of content using the encoding given by the developper``` |
delete_file | delete_file(file_full_path) | ```delete the file ( the name is given at the end of file_full_path ) at the specificied path ( given at the start of file_full_path )``` |

#### function needs to be transformed by compilers into an assembly label, the function can't be named as one of the built in types and built in functions
#### the sizeof built in function is the sizeof.asm file ( not created yet )
